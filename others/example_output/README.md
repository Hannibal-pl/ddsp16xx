This directory contains example results of using this program on some DSP16xx
code extracted from winmodem driver.

I've also add C-like interpreations of them. They are semantically correct and
compilable but they are only more readable visualisation of original code.

They was created at differen time, when my knowlege about processor and its
base firmware differs from each other. So each also show different understanding
of same features.
